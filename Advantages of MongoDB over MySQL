Advantages of MongoDB over SQL

1. MongoDB stores data as collection of JSON documents whereas MySQL stores data in tables as rows of data.

2. MySQL makes use of querying language wherein we put together a string query whereas in MongoDB we use object querying which is just passing a document and mentioning what we are querying for.

3. MySQL supports JOINs with which we can query across multiple tables. In MongoDB, it supports multiple datatypes and also allows embedding documents or attachments into another.

4. MySQL supports atomic transactions whereas MongoDB doesn support it.

5. In MongoDB there is no definite schema which has to be followed. Different documents can co exist having different schema. Whereas in MySQL, the schema should be defined before.

6. MongoDB has better performance levels than MySQL.

7. MongoDB is used when we have huge datasets as it has an advantage over relational database wherein adding additional rows can lock the entire database and create performance issues.

8. Mainly MongoDB is used when the data structure is complex and its difficult to model in a relational database system and also when we need better performance levels.
